        <h3>What is a commit?</h3>
        <p>When change is made to a branch this is called a commit. This includes adding new files, editing exisitng files and deleting files. Commits include a commit message which explains what change was made. This allows others to see and track the history of changes.</p>

    <div id="branch">
        <h3>What is a branch?</h3>
        <p>A branch is a copy of the main/master branch of the project code. This is where new features and ideas can be expreimented with without affecting the main/master branch of the code.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="pull-req">
        <h3>What is a Pull Request?</h3>
        <p>A Pull Request starts the discussion with other team members about the commits you have made to the branch. A Pull Request can be created at any point during development of a branch. This could be to review your work with the team or to discuss ideas about how to implement a new feature.</p>
        <p>After a Pull Request has been opened the team can discuss and comment on the code. Code can be edited based on the feedback from the team.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="merge">
        <h3>What is a Merge?</h3>
        <p>After changes haven been verified as being functional the branch can be added into the main/master branch.</p>
